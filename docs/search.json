I am an environmental data scientist with a\r\n            passion for using sound data science and GIS tools to\r\n            efficiently manage scarce resources in the face of a\r\n            changing climate.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Bio\r\n            I currently work as an Analyst with E Source in the Water\r\n            Loss Consulting division. Through this work, I directly\r\n            assist water utilities across the U.S. in understanding\r\n            their distribution system and billing data by analyzing\r\n            complex databases and performing audits of water supply,\r\n            distribution and consumption. This information helps\r\n            agencies meet regulatory standards and reduce the amount of\r\n            water that is considered “lost.”\r\n            \r\n            My general interests include water conservation,\r\n            spatiotemporal dynamics driven by climate scenarios, and\r\n            storytelling using data, GIS tools, and maps. Outside of\r\n            this work, I love being on the ocean with my outrigger\r\n            paddling team, baking, and all things outdoors.\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Taylor Yorkey\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n              Welcome!\r\n              Hello!
